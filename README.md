# Fundraising Widget Fullstack

The front end was built with create-react-app, and uses my preferred libraries for styling and data-fetching, styled-components and axios.
The back end is an node app using express for routing and lowdb for data storage.

# Running the Project

Navigate to the `/frontend` directory and run `yarn` to install dependencies, then `yarn start`. Repeat for the`/backend` directory.
